<h2>What is a Hair Transplant?</h2>

<p>Before diving into the specifics of our packages, it's essential to understand what a hair transplant entails. A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves removing hair follicles from one part of the body, known as the 'donor site,' and transplanting them to a bald or balding part of the body, known as the 'recipient site.' It's a popular solution for individuals experiencing hair loss and looking to regain a fuller head of hair.</p>
