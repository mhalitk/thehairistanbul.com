<h2>Hair Transplant Glossary for New Patients</h2>  
<p>Planning your first hair transplant can feel overwhelming, especially when you're hearing unfamiliar medical terms. This glossary-style guide explains the most important terms you'll encounter—so you can walk into your consultation with confidence.</p>

<h2>Core Hair Transplant Terms You Should Know</h2>  
<ul>
  <li><strong>Graft:</strong> A small unit of tissue that contains 1–4 hair follicles, used in transplantation.</li>
  <li><strong>Follicle:</strong> The root of the hair that grows under the scalp. Healthy follicles are essential for hair growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Donor Area:</strong> The part of your scalp (usually the back or sides) where healthy follicles are extracted.</li>
  <li><strong>Recipient Area:</strong> The bald or thinning area where the grafts are implanted.</li>
  <li><strong>FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction):</strong> A modern technique that removes and implants individual grafts using a microneedle.</li>
  <li><strong>DHI (Direct Hair Implantation):</strong> A variation of FUE where follicles are implanted directly with a Choi implanter pen.</li>
  <li><strong>FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation):</strong> An older technique where a strip of scalp is removed to extract grafts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pre- and Post-Procedure Terms</h2>  
<ul>
  <li><strong>Shock Loss:</strong> Temporary shedding of transplanted or surrounding hair, usually in the first few weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Scabbing:</strong> Formation of tiny crusts around grafts after surgery—normal and temporary.</li>
  <li><strong>Aftercare:</strong> The set of instructions your clinic gives to ensure healthy healing and graft survival.</li>
  <li><strong>Density:</strong> The number of grafts per square centimeter—a key factor in natural appearance.</li>
  <li><strong>Hairline Design:</strong> The aesthetic planning of how the frontal hairline will be shaped and positioned.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Terms You Might Hear from the Clinic</h2>  
<ul>
  <li><strong>Implanter Pen:</strong> A device used in DHI to insert grafts with precision and control.</li>
  <li><strong>Punch Diameter:</strong> The size of the microneedle tool used in FUE procedures (typically 0.7–1.0 mm).</li>
  <li><strong>Extraction Rate:</strong> The number of grafts a clinic can safely remove from the donor area per session.</li>
  <li><strong>Survival Rate:</strong> The percentage of transplanted grafts that successfully grow new hair.</li>
</ul>
