<h2>What Is a Graft in Hair Transplantation?</h2>  
<p>A graft is a small piece of tissue containing 1 to 4 hair follicles, harvested from the donor area (typically the back of the scalp). During a hair transplant, these grafts are relocated to thinning or bald areas to restore natural hair growth. The total number of grafts you need depends on the extent of your hair loss and your desired density.</p>

<h2>Factors That Affect Graft Requirements</h2>  
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hair Loss Severity:</strong> Classified by the Norwood Scale</li>
  <li><strong>Desired Density:</strong> Higher density = more grafts</li>
  <li><strong>Scalp Characteristics:</strong> Hair thickness, curl, and contrast with skin tone</li>
  <li><strong>Donor Area Capacity:</strong> The available number of healthy follicles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Graft vs. Hair Count: What’s the Difference?</h2>  
<p>Each graft contains 1 to 4 hairs. For example, 3000 grafts may contain 6000 to 9000 hairs. Clinics often use graft count as the planning metric, but the final hair count gives a clearer picture of density.</p>

<h2>Can You Get All Grafts in One Session?</h2>  
<p>Yes, in many cases. Thanks to techniques like FUE and DHI, modern clinics can safely transplant up to 4000–5000 grafts in a single session, depending on the patient's donor capacity and scalp health.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>  
<p><strong>How can I find out how many grafts I need?</strong><br/>The best way is to send clear photos to your clinic or schedule an in-person consultation.</p>  
<p><strong>Will the donor area grow back?</strong><br/>No, once follicles are harvested, they won’t regrow—but the area is typically dense enough to remain natural-looking.</p>  
<p><strong>Is more grafts always better?</strong><br/>Not necessarily. It's about smart distribution, natural design, and long-term planning.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Graft Count Should Be Personalized</h2>  
<p>The number of grafts needed for a successful hair transplant varies by individual. A detailed assessment by a medical expert is crucial to building a safe, effective, and natural-looking result. <strong>Contact The Hair Istanbul</strong> today to receive your free personalized estimate.</p>
